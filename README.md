<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. You must provide information to fill-out the form. This information must be stored in a spreadsheet. Look at the [documentation](https://github.com/Racerin/Mold_Assessment_Form_Automation/blob/master/documentation.md) for more information. You can also use [this template](https://github.com/Racerin/Mold_Assessment_Form_Automation/blob/master/template.tsv) to get started with the layout.

2. Save the spreadsheet file as 'file.tsv'. If not an option, save as 'file.csv' but with the 'separator' changed to 'Tab' or **'\t'**. (Google 'tsv', 'csv' for further understanding.)

3. Edit configure file. Open the 'config.json' file in a Text Editor (Notepad) and change the values of 'observer_name' from 'Darnell Baird' to your name. The forms will be submitted with your name as a result. If brave, you may play around with other values (I am not responsible for the outcome).

4. Close the file before carrying-out the next step.

5. Execute the program (To be explained.)
